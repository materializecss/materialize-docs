                Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology.
                Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.

                    <p>
                      The metaphor of material defines the relationship between space and motion. The idea is that the technology is inspired by paper and ink and is utilized to
                      facilitate creativity and innovation. Surfaces and edges provide familiar visual cues that allow users to quickly understand the technology beyond the
                      physical world.

                    <h4 class="center">Bold, graphic, intentional</h4>
                    <p>
                      Elements and components such as grids, typography, color, and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and
                      focus. Emphasis on different actions and components create a visual guide for users.

                    <h4 class="center">Motion provides meaning</h4>
                    <p>
                      Motion allows the user to draw a parallel between what they see on the screen and in real life. By providing both feedback and familiarity, this allows the
                      user to fully immerse him or herself into unfamiliar technology. Motion contains consistency and continuity in addition to giving users additional
                      subconscious information about objects and transformations.

                Due to inactivity of the original developers, MaterializeCSS has been forked by a community of enthusiasts, which continues to be fully maintained by open source
                principes since 2021. Without the many contributors who participated in this fork, this project would probably not have received any updates anymore.
