                Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design
                language that combines the classic principles of successful
                design along with innovation and technology. Google's goal is to
                develop a system of design that allows for a unified user
                experience across all their products on any platform.

                    <p>
                      The metaphor of material defines the relationship between
                      space and motion. The idea is that the technology is
                      inspired by paper and ink and is utilized to facilitate
                      creativity and innovation. Surfaces and edges provide
                      familiar visual cues that allow users to quickly
                      understand the technology beyond the physical world.

                    <h4 class="center">Bold, graphic, intentional</h4>
                    <p>
                      Elements and components such as grids, typography, color,
                      and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also
                      create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Emphasis
                      on different actions and components create a visual guide
                      for users.

                    <h4 class="center">Motion provides meaning</h4>
                    <p>
                      Motion allows the user to draw a parallel between what
                      they see on the screen and in real life. By providing both
                      feedback and familiarity, this allows the user to fully
                      immerse him or herself into unfamiliar technology. Motion
                      contains consistency and continuity in addition to giving
                      users additional subconscious information about objects
                      and transformations.

                Due to inactivity of the original developers, MaterializeCSS has
                been forked by a community of enthusiasts, which continues to be
                fully maintained by open source principes since 2021. Without
                the many contributors who participated in this fork, this
                project would probably not have received any updates anymore.
